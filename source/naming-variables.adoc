= Naming Variables
HelloWorld Team


NOTE: The term "variables" also refers to function and class names.

* A variable may start with a digit (e.g. `FUNC 2d() { ... }`.
* A variable must not only consist of ascii digits.
* A variable should not only consist of a single question mark (`?`).
* A variable should have a self-explanatory name unless used as a counter variable or in a closure.
* Words should be seperated by underscores (`_`) (e.g. `FUNC repeat_until_done() { ... }`).
* Functions that return a boolean should be suffixed by a question mark (`?`) (e.g. `FUNC empty?() -> Boolean { ... }`).
* Functions that return an amount of something should be prefixed by a number sign (`#`) (e.g.
  `FUNC #collected_coins() -> Number { ... }`).
